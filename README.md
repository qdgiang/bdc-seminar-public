# Anaconda
- Create an environment with Python 3.9.13
- Activate the environment

# FastAPI Exercise 1
- Navigate to folder `fastapi-1`
- Download the packages required: `FastAPI` and `Uvicorn` server
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation)
  - [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/#quickstart)
- Run the server
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- Check out the API at `localhost:8000/docs`
- You can also use `curl` command to test your API. For example, to get the square value of 591, run
```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/square/591' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) is also an execllent option to test your API.
# FastAPI Exercise 2
- Navigate to folder `fastapi-2`
- Download another package: `Jinja`
  - [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/intro/#installation)
- Run the server
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- Check out the API at `localhost:8000/docs`
- We also have a rendered template at `localhost:8000/index` for a quick preview of how the API work on a full-fledged web site.

# FastAPI Exercise 3
- Navigate to folder `fastapi-3`
- Download the packages for YOLOv5 model with the `requirements.txt`
- Run the server
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- Check out the new API at `localhost:8000/docs`
- We have a secret message! 
```
VGhpcyBpcyBkZWZpbml0ZWx5IG5vdCBteSBwYXNzd29yZA==
```
Try calling the decoder at `/secretdecoder` from `curl`, Postman or FastAPI's Swagger UI. What's the message?
- Try sending an image in the `test-images` folder to the API at `/image2image` and see what happens.
# Docker Exercise 1
- Pull the image `qdgiang/seminar-ex1`
- Run the image **in detached mode**
- Exec inside the image with the command `/bin/sh`
- Read the content of the file `hello.txt` there
- Exit from inside the container
- Stop the running container
- Delete the stopped container
# Docker Exercise 2
- Pull the image `qdgiang/seminar-ex2`
- Run the image **in foreground mode**, and read what is printed on the terminal
- Can you change the environment variable with an updated `docker run` command this time?
# Docker Exercise 3
- Navigate to the folder `fastapi-1`
- Update the Dockerfile to build the image for the server
- Build the image using `docker build` command. Remember to set your own name for the image using the `-t` flag
- Run your build image in detached mode. Remember to **map the port** from your computer to inside your container using the `-p` flag. Hint: The FastAPI server **inside the container** is opened at the port that you defined in the ENTRYPOINT command.
- Check out the API at `localhost:PORT_THAT_YOU_JUST_MAP/docs`. If you can see the UI, congrats!
# Docker Exercise 4
- Navigate to the folder `docker-4`
- There's no need to do anything this time :). Just run `docker compose up --build` and enjoy the result.
- Open the web at localhost
- Try sending the same secret message from FastAPI Exercise 3. Can you see communication between different parts of the website? If yes, congrats, you have sucessfully composed the frontend and backend service into a working website.

# Bonus
- Exec into the `docker-testing` container. Can you ping the `docker-fastapi` container from there?
- Try `curl`-ing from `docker-testing`. What's wrong?
- When you fix the error above, can you `curl` using the same `curl` command from FastAPI Exercise 1? Why or why not?
- Update your `curl` command. Note that the backend server is now openning at port `8080` (so make sure to always read the code üêß).
- If you update it right, you will be able to `curl` into the backend container from the testing container now, meaning the components inside our website are worling properly and connected to each other.
